# 2024 ADSA NANP Workshop

The goal of is to demonstrate examples on data analysis of diurnal variation of enteric gas emission. Mixed models with repeated measures and cosine function of time (daily rhythm | biorhythm) are used to evaluate the effects of treatments on enteric CH4 emission.

Please download R codes (2024NANP_CircadianRhythm_v1.R and 2024NANP_RepeatedMeausres_v1) and dataset (2024NANP_EntericGasData.xlsx).

Further questions should be directed to Leoni F. Martins at leonimartins@psu.edu.
